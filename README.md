# Amazon Rainforest Deforestation Visualization

Link to GitHub Pages: [https://ds4200-s23-class.github.io/project-amazon-deforestation/]

This project was intended to practice the pipeline of developing a novel visualization of the Amazon Rainforest and its deforestation. Through CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, the team created interactive visualizations including a bar chart overlaid by a line plot that enables the user to select a specific year and year range to view the proportion of the area deforested, a dotted representation of the percentage of the Amazon remaining after the selected year, and a pie chart displaying the percentage of the Amazon forested and deforested in that selected year. These can be viewed on the "Visualizations" tab. In the "Motivation & Background" tab, we explain the domain, use case, and data, as well as havin a demo video and report access. Our final tab, "Acknowledgements," contains resources we referenced throughout the completion of the project.
