Hi everyone! For our project, Jenny, JC, Varun, 
and I focused on Amazon deforestation. 

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.006 align:center
So, as you see here, uh, this is our webpage, 
and it's split into three tabs, the first of which 
represents the motivation and background 
for our project.

3
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:24.800 align:center
So, you see we have information about the 
domain, uh, tasks, the use case, the data that 
we sought after, as well as the biases and 
ethics revolved around the data.

4
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:33.111 align:center
Uh, the second tab has our two visual 
encodings, the first of which, uh, represents a 
histogram overlaid by a line plot

5
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:39.550 align:center
representing, on the x-axis, the 21 years 
involved in our data, so 2000 thr- through 
2021.

6
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.450 align:center
And then on the y-axis is the proportion of 
area deforested.

7
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:48.200 align:center
And so, with this plot, the user can hover over 
any of the bars, as well as any of the points.

8
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.600 align:center
And so if I select the first bar, for example, a 
tooltip will show up on the left side that 
shows the year range representative of that 
bar,

9
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.200 align:center
as well as the average proportion of areas 
deforested over that three-year range.

10
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:09.001 align:center
And then, if I click on, say, this point right 
here, a tooltip will show up on the right that 
represents, or that shows, that year of the 
point selected and then the proportion of 
area deforested for that year.

11
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.700 align:center
And then, whatever point the user selects is 
how the three visualizations are linked.

12
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.001 align:center
And so, if we scroll down on this page, on the 
left side is the first plot of Visual Encoding 2,

13
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:27.001 align:center
which is a scatterplot with 200 points 
representative of the percentage of the 
Amazon Rainforest remaining in a certain 
year.

14
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:36.700 align:center
And so, in this case with 2001, uh, all the 
green points represent the proportion of the 
forest that's left, so, in this case, 91.5%.

15
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.001 align:center
And the brown dots represent the proportion 
of the forest that's been deforested, so, uh, 
8.5%.

16
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:51.800 align:center
And this same data is portrayed in the pie 
chart to the right, which shows the percent 
deforested in this yellow slice, so in this case, 
8.3%.

17
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.001 align:center
And then, the green slice is about 91.8%.

18
00:01:55.001 --> 00:02:00.000 align:center
And then, at the top, is the third tab, is just 
our resources. Thank you.
